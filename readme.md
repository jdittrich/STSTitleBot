# STS Title Bot #

Is a grammar for creating possible but artificial titles for [Science and Technology Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_studies) publications.
It was modeled by clicking on [EASST](https://easst2018.easst.net/) panels and looking at the publication titles for an extended amount of time.


## Technology ##
STS Title Bot runs on [tracery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery).
To try the grammar localy, I checked in a website for testing and tracery.

## Contributing ##

Extensions should 

1. Not make the code super complicated
2. Be modeled on real world STS publications
3. Not generate inflammatory sentences/titles
